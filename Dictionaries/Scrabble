1.We have provided you with two lists, letters and points. We would like to combine these two into a dictionary that would map a letter to its point value.create a dictionary called letter_to_points that has the elements of letters as the keys and the elements of points as the values.

2.We want to create a function that will take in a word and return how many points that word is worth.Define a function called score_word that takes in a parameter word.

3.Inside score_word, create a variable called point_total.
